An implementation of RSA cryptosystem and a simple digital signature scheme using custom cryptographic methods, demonstrating how RSA encryption/decryption works along with a basic hash function for signing and verifying messages. It serves as an educational reference for learning cryptography, particularly RSA, and its application in digital signatures. Key features include prime number generation, Euler’s Totient function calculation, modular exponentiation, public and private key generation, and RSA-based message encryption/decryption. The digital signature scheme uses a custom hash function for signing and verifying messages. The process involves generating two large prime numbers, calculating the RSA modulus `n`, computing Euler's Totient function `φ(n)`, and deriving public and private keys through modular arithmetic. Messages are encrypted using the public key and decrypted with the private key. The digital signature works by applying the custom hash function to generate a digest, which is signed with the private key and verified using the public key.
